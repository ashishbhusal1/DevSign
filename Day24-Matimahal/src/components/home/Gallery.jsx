          We came from Nepal to Japan with a dream of starting a small business
          and offering our customers a unique food experience. That's how
          Matimahal Restaurant & Bar was born. Thanks to our amazing team of
          staff, chefs, and members, we have enjoyed serving our wonderful
          customers and we will always work and serve with passion.
